</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The wonderful Scala by Example pdf by the creator Martin Odersky himself
has a quicksort program written in <a class="reference external" href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a>. Its a beautiful piece of
succinct code that lays clearly the quicksort algorithm. I started
digging into Scala a couple of months back and being a <a class="reference external" href="http://guttingpython.blogspot.com">lover of
Python</a>, the fact that it didnt need semicolons for indentation was a
pleasure to see. As I dug into it further, it seemed I was learning some
very new concepts, which I hadnt learned in a while sticking to
languages like Java, .NET and even Python. The concept of Actors, Case
Classes with pattern matching, parametric classes, variances to name a
few were extremely delightful to learn.</p>

<p>system. Coming from languages where the concept of types exposed were
mainly primitive types and objects, the concept of a type being much
more than that was eye-opening.</p>

<p>runs on the jvm. Just like people gravitated towards Python or Ruby when
they became popular, it seems like the same thing is happening with
Scala and Clojure. I discovered Python before Ruby and when exploring
Python I was so enamoured with the functionality, the ease of
programming and the productivity that when I looked at Ruby, it had to
be something a lot more than Python for it to catch my eye.</p>

<p>So that was mainly what nudged me into the Python camp. I see the same
happening with Scala now. I tried it out first, and it seems like it
could teach me so much that I would like to be in the Scala camp for
now. And &quot;for now&quot; has a good chance of being &quot;forever&quot;.</p>
