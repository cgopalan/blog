<p>ways. This weblog is to explore, refine, clarify and elucidate ideas in
software development - a profession that has helped me earn a living,
and by virtue of doing which continuously for a few years, I have
developed a deep interest and love for. This interest is the result of a
cycle that has been set in motion by a yearning to learn more about it
so that one can be better, which in turn infuses in one an enthusiasm to
learn more just because they enjoy their achievements attained by
learning.
| The interesting about this is now I feel that I am in a different
plane of existence. Seems like the constant spinning of the cycle has
catapulted me into a different mental state, where I feel there is so
much more to learn and knowledge seems never-ending. This is different
from my previous plane of existence, where I was doing just what was
supposed to be done, limiting myself to only knowledge of my
specialization.
| I must admit that at first, this new mental state left me more
insecure, as its like exposing a huge waterfall to a camel thats happy
drinking just the small amounts of water available in the desert. But
then I realized that it is necessary to see the waterfall so that you
can get an idea of how small the desert water sources are. And it is
necessary to know that the water sources are small. It is necessary to
know that you are ignorant....because only then can you think about
achieving mastery.</p>
