<p>to elucidate what my idea was of a good IT manager.
| 1. Someone who makes every team member comfortable in his presence.
This is actually very difficult to achieve and has to be done only by
letting one's guard down, admitting there are areas which the manager
doesn't himself understand, and is very eager to go a developer for
help.
| 2. If the developer is having a technical problem the manager says
&quot;hmm cmon lets see how this will work&quot; and actually sits down, pairs
with him to do a tracer bullet - a small proof of concept.
| 3. The manager should show by his actions that he is concerned by the
well-being of the team. This means hes genuinely interested in the
developers career growth and to some extent personal issues.
| 4. Last but most important, he sits with the team and all the team
members sit together. I am a very strong proponent of this and really
cringe when I see people isolated in cubes.
| This might be in conflict with some people that think managing is
removed from the technical aspect of what the manager manages, but I
believe that the opinion is flawed. In short, if the manager has not had
adequate technical history, he will always be found wanting regardless
of how good he is at dealing with people. This of course assumes that
the role of the manager is to make sure that the product or service
developed by the &quot;workers&quot; is delivered on time to the customers and
reasonably within budget.</p>
