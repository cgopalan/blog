<p>Development with Rails`_, written by <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David
Heinemeier Hansson</a>. I discovered rails about 6 months ago and started
reading about it. I was fascinated by the simplicity and the ease of
development that it offered in quickly putting together a fully
functional web application. Needless to say, in just over a year after
its creation, it has captured the hearts and minds of programmers and
web designers alike.
| There are many facets to rails that make it worthy of being the one of
the foremost choices in developing web applications, like clear
separation of model view controller functionality and in-built testing
support - besides the inherent advantage of having a dynamic language
like Ruby at its core. However, there is one more rarely-exploited
paradigm that it uses that really struck a chord with me - the fact that
it stresses &quot;convention over configuration&quot;. Rails does not have XML
files for specifying the configuration aspects of the application. It
assumes certain values and uses those to power the rest of the
application.
| What does this exactly mean? It means that configuration information
is already predetermined by rails and it urges the programmer to name
objects a certain way and put files and resources in specific
predetermined directories. One would think that this is very
restrictive, but the fact is that it doesnt seem restrictive at all when
most of it is done by the framework itself! It creates the directories,
creates the templates for the files, so that what falls on the shoulders
of the programmer is the actual business logic. It is like it says,
&quot;Dont worry about maintaining configuration info, I will lay it out and
make sure its all in place. You just worry about implementing the
requirements in code.&quot;
| Imagine what this means in terms of application maintenance. A new
programmer entrusted with making changes to a rails application coded by
another developer already knows where everything is, and how the basic
components are named. No flailing around trying to make sense of
variable and object names!
| It definitely is worthwhile trying out and working on a framework that
works on the &quot;convention over configuration&quot; principle. This may not be
for all, but is perfect for a framework if it has to be true to its
promise of blazing speed in putting together a working application. And
Rails does a great job there, no question.</p>
