<p>was XML Devcon 2000! It was good, but not as enriching as I hoped it
would be. I suspect that maybe because of 2 factors: one, the general
concept of XML was not very appealing to me, ie, while developing,
consuming or writing out xml, it does not give me a rush. Second, my
understanding of software concepts was clouded too much by what was
happening in the world, without me having my own perspective. As folks
dished out their own takes and the &quot;one right way&quot; to do stuff, I lapped
it all up, not thinking much for myself.
| Six years later, I dont how much has changed on my side, but I do like
where I am now. I do have perspectives on what &quot;superior&quot; languages or
frameworks are, and I do feel a certain rush when I understand or
implement concepts. At the same time, having these perspectives has also
oddly left me with more tolerance for accepting other concepts or
approaches that were previously frowned upon by the &quot;best practice&quot;
advocates. So with this bent of mind, I am eager to see how my
experience will be at the conference.
| Besides the fact that the conference is about a subject that I love
developing with, it also boasts speakers that I have always wanted to
hear - like <a class="reference external" href="http://martinfowler.com">Martin Fowler</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>. In the beginning of the
year, while announcing the keynote speakers for the conference, <a class="reference external" href="http://chadfowler.com">Chad
Fowler</a> said &quot;If you can only make it to one conference this year, let
RailsConf be the one&quot;.
| I am happy I listened.</p>
